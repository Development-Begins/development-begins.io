                                            <p>Bhaiya is amongst the most enthusiastic people I have met. Despite being so highly qualified, he still finds time for his juniors and has fun and also guides. His clarity in his field is much more than even the interviewers I have met so far. Apart from his technical and product skills, he is also a classic flute player, making him an all rounder. Despite having to make a lot of effort, he never misses to join us in organising YES!+ courses at insititute.</p>

                                            <p>Satwik Bhaiya is amongst the most caring bhaiyas I have had. He has aspirations for his juniors in the long term, and is always guiding in the right direction. He has covered a lot in the varied fields that he has worked on, and is willing to pass on that info to us all. He is the only senior I have on whose judgements and descision I can fully know to be flawless. Thankful to Gurudev to have him with me in this crucial period of life.</p>

He is a planned out person and is very practical. I find myself sometimes having learnt a lesson or two from him. I am sure he will definitely achieve something worthwhile.</p>

                                            <p>Sandeep is one of the people who have realised the value of spiritual path on his own, and has a good enough understanding of himself. He is a natural seeker, a quality that guarantees growth in all aspects of life. He is unaware of what all he can achive and has great untapped potential. I see myself in him, and have big hopes from his career.</p>

                                            <p>Bhaiya is what I must say to be my short-term goal in spirituality. His personality is something I could only understand after Advanced Course. Along with being an example of what spirituality can help in achiving a pleasant and peacefull state of mind, he also is a live example of the popular phrase in gita : <i>Yogah Karmasu Kaushalam</i>. I aim to transcend him in this matter.</p>

He is a student and is also an Art Of Living teacher, which makes him the best guide I have found so far in youth issues. Hardly anyone's words of advice have reached me as well as his has. When it comes the time to act, bhaiya fills the environment with such an energy that works round the clock.</p>

Across time, I have recieved a lot from him, including getting the opportuinity of meeting Gurudev in person at college, and having lunch with Dinesh bhaiya. Had it not been for him, I wouldn't have been active in Art Of Living, and thus would have just being anathor jerk in life.</p>
